# pandas-challenge

In this project I was asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results.
I created a snapshot from the data showing the following a summary of the district student number, budget, and subject scores. 
As well as school-specific summary with similar data. 

I sorted new data frames showing the highest-performing schools in ascending order, and lowest performing in descending order.
I created data frames specific to math scores by grade, reading scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type. 

I created my script in Jupyter notebook. This code must be run on Jupyter to be tested. You must also have schools complete and student complete csv correct path that is located in the resources folder.
